# Summer_Internship_22IT062

From May 13th to June 13th, I embarked on a transformative internship in web technology, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over this month, I honed my skills and gained hands-on experience by tackling various tasks and creating dynamic web pages. Each task presented unique challenges, from designing a responsive News Reporting website to crafting for selling chairs, complete with a header navigation bar, hero section, and testimonial section. I also developed an admin page, enhancing the user interface and managing database interactions.
